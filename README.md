# What works:
	A few blocks/roundblocks
	If Statements
	Input (keyboard)
 	Variables
	Broadcasts
	Sprites
	Costumes
	Sounds (Kinda, some are a static mess or are incorrect in some way or don't play at all)
	(Maybe some more I'm not thinking about right now)
 # What doesn't work:
 	layers (while the implementation is there, it does not work correctly)
	Custom blocks
	Text in SVGs
	While loops
	(And a lot more, these are just some examples)

Sorry if this README is awful, I don't know what I'm doing :D
