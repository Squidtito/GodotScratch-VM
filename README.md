# What works:
    A few blocks
    Broadcasts
    Sprites
    Costumes
    Sounds (Kinda, some are a static mess or are incorrect in some way)
    (Maybe some more I'm not thinking about right now)
 # What doesn't work:
    Variables
    Custom blocks
    Support for round blocks
    Text in SVGs
    If statements
    Any kind of loop (except forever loops)
    (And a lot more, these are just some examples)

Sorry if this README is awful, I don't know what I'm doing :D
